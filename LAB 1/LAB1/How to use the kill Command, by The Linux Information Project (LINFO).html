<p>
The <i>kill</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a> to terminate <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>processes</i></a> without having to log out or <i>reboot</i> (i.e., restart) the computer. Thus, it is particularly important to the stability of such systems.
</p>

<p>
A process, also referred to as a <i>task</i>, is an <i>executing</i> (i.e., running) instance of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a>. Each process is automatically assigned a unique <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pid.html"><i>process identification number</i></a> (PID) when it is created for use by the system to reference the process. 
</p>

<p>
The syntax for kill is

</p><blockquote>
<p>
<code>kill [signal</code> or <code>option] PID(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a> (i.e., input) that is required is a PID, and as many PIDs as desired can be used in a single command. Typically no signal or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a> is used. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, if it is desired to terminate a process with a PID of 485, the following will usually be sufficient:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>kill 485</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kill command has a misleading name because it does not actually <i>kill</i> processes. Rather, it sends signals to them. Each process is supplied with a set of standard <i>signal handlers</i> by the operating system in order to deal with incoming signals. When no signal is explicitly included in the command, <i>signal 15</i>, named SIGTERM, is sent by default. If this fails, the stronger <i>signal 9</i>, called SIGKILL, should be used. For example, the following command would nearly guarantee that process 485 would be killed: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>kill -9 485</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The only situation in which signal 9 will fail is if the process is in the midst of making a <i>system call</i>, which is a request to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html"><i>kernel</i></a>
 (i.e., the core of the operating system) for some action such as 
process creation. In this situation, the process will die once it has 
returned from the system call.
</p>

<p> 
There are more than 60 signals that can be used with kill, but, 
fortunately, most users will only need to be aware of signal 9. The full
 list is contained in the file <i>/usr/include/linux/signal.h</i> and can be viewed by using kill with its <i>-l</i> option, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>kill -l</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obvious signs of misbehaving processes are programs that <a href="http://www.linfo.org/crash.html"><i>crash</i></a> (i.e., appear to <i>freeze</i>
 or otherwise stop operating as expected) or that cannot be shut down 
normally (e.g., by clicking on a button or using using a menu command). 
The first step in such situation is to obtain the PID(s) of the 
offending process(es). This can often be accomplished with the help of 
the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ps.html"><i>ps</i></a> command, usually with its <i>-a</i>, <i>-u</i> and <i>-x</i> options (which tell it to list all processes and provide detailed information about them), i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ps -aux | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the list of processes can be quite long, the output of <i>ps -aux</i> can be <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html"><i>piped</i></a> (i.e., transferred) to the <i>less</i>
 command, which lets it be viewed one screenful at a time. The list can 
be advanced one screen forward by pressing the SPACE bar and one screen 
backward by pressing the <i>b</i> key.
</p>

<p>
Often it is obvious which is the offending process. However, sometimes 
it is not, particularly when the running of a program involves multiple 
processes, and thus it might be necessary to terminate several processes
 in order to close the offending program. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pstree.html"><i>pstree</i></a> command
 can also be a useful tool for finding offending processes. This is 
because it displays the names of all processes on the system in the form
 of a <i>tree diagram</i>, thereby showing all of their <i>parent/child</i> relationships. When used with its <i>-p</i> option, pstree also shows the PIDs of the processes, i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree -p | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
pstree can simplify terminating a series of related processes (i.e., a 
process and all of its descendants) because it makes it immediately 
clear which process is the parent; all that is necessary is to kill the 
parent in order to also terminate all of its descendant processes. That 
is, it is not necessary to manually search through a list of processes 
to find and individually terminate each one as would be necessary using 
ps. 
</p>

<p>
Because Unix-like operating systems and many of their <a href="http://www.linfo.org/appslist.html">application programs</a> are inherently very <a href="http://www.linfo.org/robust.html"><i>robust</i></a>
 (i.e., stable and resistant to crashing), it is not necessary to use 
the kill command as often as it is to terminate programs or reboot on 
some other operating systems. However, it does occasionally come in 
quite handy.
</p>

<p>
Despite its usefulness, however, there are situations in which the kill 
command even with its strongest signal is insufficient to terminate a 
process and rescue a frozen system or in which it is difficult to 
determine what is the offending process (or processes). In such case it 
is often easier to just reboot the system.
